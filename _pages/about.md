ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I am Yaotian Liu, a second year PhD Student in Computer Engineering at Arizona State University.

My interests include **computer architecture, digital circuit design, robotics, and machine learning**. Currently, I am focusing on efficient computing for robotics workloads and collaborating with Intel on a tapeout project. 

I enjoy learning new frameworks, languages, algorithms, and tools. I am interested in open-source projects and have contributed to several projects on GitHub. 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
